# Project 1 : Facial Keypoint Detection
Use image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face. This project tests your knowledge of image processing and feature extraction techniques that allow you to programmatically represent different facial features. Youâ€™ll also use your knowledge of deep learning techniques to program a convolutional neural network to recognize facial keypoints. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition.
