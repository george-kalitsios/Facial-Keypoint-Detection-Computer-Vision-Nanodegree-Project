# Project 1 : Facial Keypoint Detection
Use image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face. This project tests your knowledge of image processing and feature extraction techniques that allow you to programmatically represent different facial features. Youâ€™ll also use your knowledge of deep learning techniques to program a convolutional neural network to recognize facial keypoints. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition.

In this project, I build a facial keypoint detection system. The system consists of a face detector that uses Haar Cascades and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that predict the facial keypoints in the detected faces. The facial keypoint detection system takes in any image with faces and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face. The facial keypoints dataset used to train, validate and test the model consists of 5770 color images from the YouTube Faces Dataset ( https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/ ).
